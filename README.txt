Ruckusist .Dotfiles

A set of configuration files that make me comfortable in my
bash environment.

Files for Open Use:
bashrc
tmuxrc
nanorc
aliases
myhelp

Files for Specific Use:
jupyter -


The way i want this to go:
(1) clone this repo to .files
git clone https://github.com/ruckusist/dotfiles ~/.files

(2) launch a python script to do all the heavy lifting.
python .files/getright.py

(3) Should this patch existing files or replace them?
